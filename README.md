# Financing Permissively-licensed Free-Software

For the past 18 months we have been developing OS.Cash, a new way to license successful permissively-licensed free-software projects so the software remains free for all (except Billion Dollar Businesses, who purchase a license for use).

# Corporate and Commercial Track Record

I possess a proven record of delivering strategic business advice on sophisticated business and legal issues, delivering global legal management and business-minded solutions across non-U.S. jurisdictions (having lived and worked in five countries, managed legal teams in 10 different countries).

I have been serving as an adjunct faculty teaching corporate and commercial Chinese law at **four** top tier law schools in the United States for _over a decade_, and I operate several different successful businesses, and have authored several publications on Chinese law and commerce. I was also recognized as an Academy of Educational Development Fellow.
